Now let me check what changed in the files mentioned and get the git diff to understand what the recent changes are:

● Check which of these files changed in recent commits
  $ cd /home/mpb/Documents/GitHub/ai_workflow && git diff --stat HEAD~5..HEAD

The git diff shows no changes - these files were **not modified** in the most recent commit. Let me verify what actually changed:

● See what files actually changed in the latest commit
  $ cd /home/mpb/Documents/GitHub/ai_workflow && git --no-pager diff --name-only HEAD~1 HEAD
  └ 138 lines...

I see - the changes mentioned (docs/MODULE_API_REFERENCE.md, docs/ROADMAP.md, docs/developer-guide/EXTENDING_THE_WORKFLOW.md) are **not in the latest commit**. These must be the files to review for accuracy based on the **actual code changes**. The latest commit (4e96719) was about configuration-driven step execution (v4.0.0). Let me review all the documentation files to check if they accurately reflect the current codebase:

● update_todo
  └ TODO list updated

● Check if v4.0.0 is mentioned in the docs
  $ cd /home/mpb/Documents/GitHub/ai_workflow && grep -n "v4.0" docs/MODULE_API_REFERENCE.md
  docs/ROADMAP.md docs/developer-guide/EXTENDING_THE_WORKFLOW.md
  └ 13 lines...

Good - the docs already reference v4.0.0. Now let me verify if there are any inconsistencies or outdated information by checking for references to old step naming:

● Check for old step naming patterns in extending guide
  $ cd /home/mpb/Documents/GitHub/ai_workflow && grep -n "step_[0-9][0-9]_"
  docs/developer-guide/EXTENDING_THE_WORKFLOW.md | head -20
  └ 1 line...

● Check template step naming in extending guide
  $ cd /home/mpb/Documents/GitHub/ai_workflow && grep -n "step_XX"
  docs/developer-guide/EXTENDING_THE_WORKFLOW.md
  └ 3 lines...

Perfect! I found an issue. The EXTENDING_THE_WORKFLOW.md guide is using outdated step naming conventions (`step_XX_your_name.sh`) which doesn't match the v4.0.0 configuration-driven approach. Let me check for more issues:

● Read docs/developer-guide/EXTENDING_THE_WORKFLOW.md lines 48-230
  └ 188 lines read

● Find all numeric step references in extending guide
  $ cd /home/mpb/Documents/GitHub/ai_workflow && grep -n "step_[0-9]"
  docs/developer-guide/EXTENDING_THE_WORKFLOW.md | head -30
  └ 1 line...

Now I found the issues! The EXTENDING_THE_WORKFLOW.md guide needs to be updated for v4.0.0 to reflect the new configuration-driven approach. Let me check the actual step structure to see how it should be documented:

● List directory src/workflow/steps
  └ 61 files found

● Check actual step structure in v4.0.0
  $ cd /home/mpb/Documents/GitHub/ai_workflow && head -80
  src/workflow/steps/documentation_updates.sh
  └ 81 lines...

Now I can see the actual structure. Let me also check how workflow_steps.yaml is configured:

● Find workflow_steps.yaml config file
  $ cd /home/mpb/Documents/GitHub/ai_workflow && find . -name "workflow_steps.yaml" -type f
  2>/dev/null | head -5
  └ 1 line...

● Find YAML config files in .workflow_core
  $ cd /home/mpb/Documents/GitHub/ai_workflow && find .workflow_core -name "*.yaml" -type f
  2>/dev/null
  └ 7 lines...

Let me check the .workflow-config.yaml file to see the step configuration:

● Check workflow config for step definitions
  $ cd /home/mpb/Documents/GitHub/ai_workflow && cat .workflow-config.yaml | head -150
  └ 27 lines...

Now let me check the MIGRATION_GUIDE to understand the v4.0.0 changes properly:

● Read docs/MIGRATION_GUIDE_v4.0.md lines 1-150
  └ 154 lines read

Perfect! Now I understand the v4.0.0 changes. Let me create a comprehensive analysis and provide the necessary updates:

## Documentation Analysis

After reviewing the codebase and documentation, I found that **most documentation is accurate and up-to-date for v4.0.0**, but the **EXTENDING_THE_WORKFLOW.md** guide needs updates to reflect the new configuration-driven approach.

### Issues Found:

1. **docs/developer-guide/EXTENDING_THE_WORKFLOW.md** (Line 53-222):
   - Uses outdated step naming conventions (`step_XX_your_name.sh`)
   - References numeric step identifiers throughout examples
   - Step integration instructions don't reflect YAML configuration
   - Doesn't mention v4.0.0 configuration-driven approach

### Files Already Current:

- ✅ **docs/MODULE_API_REFERENCE.md**: Correctly documents v4.0.0 features
- ✅ **docs/ROADMAP.md**: Accurately describes v4.0.0 status and features
- ✅ **README.md**: Mentions v4.0.0 and configuration-driven steps
- ✅ **.github/copilot-instructions.md**: Documents v4.0.0 features

## Required Updates

● update_todo
  └ TODO list updated

● Edit docs/developer-guide/EXTENDING_THE_WORKFLOW.md (+3 -1)

● Edit docs/developer-guide/EXTENDING_THE_WORKFLOW.md (+8 -5)

● Edit docs/developer-guide/EXTENDING_THE_WORKFLOW.md (+7 -6)

Now let me verify the changes and ensure the documentation is consistent:

● Review the changes made to EXTENDING_THE_WORKFLOW.md
  $ cd /home/mpb/Documents/GitHub/ai_workflow && git --no-pager diff
  docs/developer-guide/EXTENDING_THE_WORKFLOW.md | head -150
  └ 151 lines...

Excellent! The changes look good. Now let me complete the final verification and create a summary:

● update_todo
  └ TODO list updated

● Check document length
  $ cd /home/mpb/Documents/GitHub/ai_workflow && wc -l
  docs/developer-guide/EXTENDING_THE_WORKFLOW.md
  └ 2 lines...

● Verify v4.0 references added
  $ cd /home/mpb/Documents/GitHub/ai_workflow && grep -c "v4.0"
  docs/developer-guide/EXTENDING_THE_WORKFLOW.md
  └ 2 lines...

Perfect! Let me create a final summary document:

● Create summary report
  $ cd /home/mpb/Documents/GitHub/ai_workflow && cat > /tmp/documentation_update_summary.md <<
  'EOF'
  # Documentation Update Summary - 2026-02-08
