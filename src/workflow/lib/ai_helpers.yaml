# Documentation Analysis Prompt Template
doc_analysis_prompt:
  role: |
    You are a senior technical documentation specialist with expertise in software 
    architecture documentation, API documentation, and developer experience (DX) optimization.
    
    **Critical Behavioral Guidelines**:
    - ALWAYS provide concrete, actionable output (never ask clarifying questions)
    - If documentation is accurate, explicitly say "No updates needed - documentation is current"
    - Only update what is truly outdated or incorrect
    - Make informed decisions based on available context
    - Default to "no changes" rather than making unnecessary modifications 
  
  task_template: |
    **YOUR TASK**: Analyze the changed files and make specific edits to update the documentation.
    
    **Changed files**: {changed_files}
    **Documentation to review**: {doc_files}
    
    **REQUIRED ACTIONS**:
    1. **Read the changes**: Examine what was modified in each changed file
    2. **Identify documentation impact**: Determine which docs need updates:
       - .github/copilot-instructions.md (project overview, architecture, key files)
       - README.md (features, setup instructions, usage examples)
       - Technical docs (architecture changes, new features)
       - Module READMEs (if code in that module changed)
       - Inline comments (for complex new logic)
    3. **Determine changes**: Identify exact sections requiring updates
    4. **Verify accuracy**: Ensure examples and references are still correct
    
    **OUTPUT FORMAT**: Use edit blocks showing before/after, or provide specific line-by-line changes.
  
  approach: |
    1. **Analyze**: Review git diff to understand scope of changes
    2. **Prioritize**: Start with most critical docs (README, copilot-instructions)
    3. **Edit surgically**: Provide EXACT text changes (before/after blocks), not suggestions. Change ONLY affected sections, preserve everything else
    4. **Verify consistency**: Keep terminology, formatting, style uniform
    
    **CRITICAL**: Make concrete, actionable edits with exact before/after text. Don't ask questions - make the changes.

      - "Run shellcheck regularly"

# Language-Specific Test Patterns
language_specific_testing:
  javascript:
    framework: "Jest"
    patterns:
      - "Use describe/it blocks"
      - "Mock external dependencies"
      - "Test async code with async/await"
      - "Use snapshot testing for UI"
      - "Test error boundaries"
    
    example: |
      describe('UserService', () => {
        it('fetches user by ID', async () => {
          expect((await UserService.getUser('123')).id).toBe('123');
        });
      });
  
  python:
    framework: "pytest"
    patterns:
      - "Use fixtures for setup"
      - "Parametrize tests with @pytest.mark.parametrize"
      - "Use mocking with unittest.mock"
      - "Test exceptions with pytest.raises"
      - "Use coverage reporting"
    
    example: |
      @pytest.mark.parametrize("input,expected", [(2, 4), (3, 9)])
      def test_square(input, expected):
          assert square(input) == expected
  
  go:
    framework: "testing"
    patterns:
      - "Use table-driven tests"
      - "Test error cases explicitly"
      - "Use subtests for organization"
      - "Mock interfaces with testify"
      - "Use test helpers"
    
    example: |
      func TestAdd(t *testing.T) {
          tests := []struct{name string; a, b, want int}{
              {"positive", 2, 3, 5}, {"negative", -1, -1, -2}}
          for _, tt := range tests {
              t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
                  if got := Add(tt.a, tt.b); got != tt.want {
                      t.Errorf("got %d, want %d", got, tt.want) }})}}
  
  java:
    framework: "JUnit 5"
    patterns:
      - "Use @Test annotation"
      - "Organize with @Nested classes"
      - "Use @ParameterizedTest"
      - "Mock with Mockito"
      - "Use AssertJ for fluent assertions"
    
    example: |
      @Test
      void testCalculateTotal() {
          assertThat(calculator.add(new BigDecimal("10.5"),
              new BigDecimal("5.5"))).isEqualByComparingTo("16.0");
      }
  
  ruby:
    framework: "RSpec"
    patterns:
      - "Use describe/context/it blocks"
      - "Use let for lazy evaluation"
      - "Use factories (FactoryBot)"
      - "Test with doubles and mocks"
      - "Use shared examples"
    
    example: |
      RSpec.describe Calculator do
        it 'adds two numbers' do
          expect(Calculator.add(2, 3)).to eq(5)
        end
      end
  
  rust:
    framework: "built-in"
    patterns:
      - "Use #[test] attribute"
      - "Test panics with #[should_panic]"
      - "Use Result<(), E> for fallible tests"
      - "Integration tests in tests/"
      - "Use assert! and assert_eq! macros"
    
    example: |
      #[test]
      fn test_add() { assert_eq!(add(2, 3), 5); }
      #[test]
      #[should_panic(expected = "divide by zero")]
      fn test_divide_by_zero() { divide(10, 0); }
  
  cpp:
    framework: "Google Test"
    patterns:
      - "Use TEST and TEST_F macros"
      - "Fixtures for setup/teardown"
      - "Use EXPECT_* for non-fatal assertions"
      - "Use ASSERT_* for fatal assertions"
      - "Mock with Google Mock"
    
    example: |
      TEST(MathTest, Addition) {
          EXPECT_EQ(add(2, 3), 5);
          EXPECT_EQ(add(-1, 1), 0);
      }
  
  bash:
    framework: "bats"
    patterns:
      - "Use @test for test cases"
      - "Use setup/teardown hooks"
      - "Test exit codes explicitly"
      - "Capture and test output"
      - "Use run for command execution"
    
    example: |
      @test "addition works" {
        [ "$(add 2 3)" -eq 5 ]
      }
      @test "script fails on invalid input" {
        run myscript --invalid; [ "$status" -ne 0 ]
      }
