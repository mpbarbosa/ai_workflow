I need more information about your request. You've provided a YAML configuration file with AI prompt templates but haven't specified:

1. **Role**: What role should I take? (reviewer, analyst, implementer, etc.)
2. **Task**: What specific task do you want me to perform?
3. **Approach**: How should I approach this task?

Could you please clarify what you'd like me to do with this YAML prompt configuration? For example:

- Review and provide feedback on the prompts?
- Analyze specific persona templates for improvements?
- Check consistency and quality across all prompts?
- Implement changes to improve specific sections?
- Generate new prompt templates for missing use cases?
