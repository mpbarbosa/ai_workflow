I need to see the actual changes that were made to understand what documentation needs to be updated. Let me check the git status and recent changes.

✓ Check git status for changed files
 $ cd /home/mpb/Documents/GitHub/ai_workflow && git --no-pager status
    └ 26 lines...

✓ Check unstaged changes
 $ cd /home/mpb/Documents/GitHub/ai_workflow && git --no-pager diff
    └ 46 lines...

✓ Check staged changes
 $ cd /home/mpb/Documents/GitHub/ai_workflow && git --no-pager diff --cached
    └ 259 lines...

The prompt indicates that the documentation specialist AI is being invoked, but I can see from the git diff that there are no actual code changes - only new workflow execution logs, checkpoints, and backlog files from automated workflow runs. The prompt itself shows empty changed files (`**Task**: Based on the recent changes to the following files:` with nothing listed).

Since there are no actual code changes to analyze, and the prompt was malformed (no files listed), there's nothing to document. The logs show routine workflow execution artifacts being created, which are ephemeral and don't require documentation updates.

**Analysis Complete**: No documentation updates needed. The changes shown are automated workflow execution artifacts (logs, checkpoints, backlog reports) from workflow runs, not code changes requiring documentation. The AI documentation prompt was invoked with an empty file list, indicating no substantive changes to document.
