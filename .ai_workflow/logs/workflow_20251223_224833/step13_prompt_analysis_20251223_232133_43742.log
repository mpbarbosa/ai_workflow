I need more context from you to provide a thorough analysis of the `ai_helpers.yaml` prompt configuration. Could you provide:

1. **Your Role**: What perspective should I analyze this from? (e.g., prompt engineer, workflow maintainer, AI specialist)

2. **Your Task**: What specific analysis are you looking for? (e.g., quality assessment, optimization opportunities, consistency check, token efficiency)

3. **Your Approach**: What should I focus on? (e.g., all personas, specific personas, structural issues, language-specific sections)

Based on the YAML content you shared, I can see this is **v3.0.0** of the AI prompt templates with:
- **14 persona prompt templates** (doc_analysis through step13_prompt_engineer)
- **Language-specific sections** for 8 languages (JavaScript, Python, Go, Java, Ruby, Rust, C++, Bash)
- **Structured format** with role, task_template, and approach sections

Please clarify your role, task, and approach so I can provide the specific analysis you need.
