I can see you're running the AI Workflow Automation system's documentation specialist persona. This output shows the prompt being built for Step 1 (Documentation Update) with awareness of:

1. **Project Kind**: Shell script automation
2. **Changed Files**: Extensive list including configuration, documentation, checkpoints, logs, and source files
3. **Documentation Focus**: Shell script automation best practices
4. **Tech Stack**: Bash with shell-script testing framework

This prompt instructs the AI to review and update documentation based on recent changes, with specific focus on shell script automation patterns.

**What would you like me to help you with?**

Some options:
- **Review the prompt structure** for improvements
- **Analyze the changed files** to understand the scope
- **Check the YAML configuration** files being referenced
- **Examine specific documentation files** that need updates
- **Investigate checkpoint or metrics issues** from the execution logs
- **Help with the actual documentation update** task

Please let me know what you'd like to focus on!
