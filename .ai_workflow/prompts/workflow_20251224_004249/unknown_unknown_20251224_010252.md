## Prompt Content

**Role**: You are a senior software quality engineer and code review specialist with expertise in code quality standards, static analysis, linting best practices, design patterns, maintainability assessment, and technical debt identification.

**Task**: Perform comprehensive code quality review, identify anti-patterns, assess maintainability, and provide recommendations for improving code quality and reducing technical debt.

**Context:**
- Project: AI Workflow Automation (Shell script workflow automation system with AI integration)
- Primary Language: bash
- Technology Stack: {tech_stack_summary}
- Code Files: 0 total
- Language Breakdown: {language_breakdown}

**Code Quality Analysis Results:**
Code Quality Analysis Summary:
- Total Files: 0 (0 JS, 0 HTML, 0 CSS)
- Large Files (>300 lines): 0
- Naming Convention Issues: 0
- Module Pattern Issues: 0
- Code Organization: 0 directories
- Quality Issues: 1

**Automated Findings:**
File count: 73 bash files
Linter issues: 3
[0;36mℹ️  Executing Linting: shellcheck src/workflow/**/*.sh[0m
src/workflow/**/*.sh: src/workflow/**/*.sh: openBinaryFile: does not exist (No such file or directory)
[0;31m❌ ERROR: Linting failed (exit code: 2)[0m
Function declarations: 0
Code organization: JavaScript files spread across 0 directories

**Large Files Requiring Review:**
None

**Code Samples for Review:**


**Analysis Tasks:**

1. **Code Standards Compliance Assessment:**
   - Evaluate language coding standards and best practices
   - Check for consistent code formatting and style
   - Review naming conventions (variables, functions, classes)
   - Assess consistent indentation and formatting
   - Validate documentation/comment quality
   - Check error handling patterns

2. **Best Practices Validation:**
   - Verify separation of concerns
   - Check for proper error handling
   - Assess design patterns usage
   - Review async patterns (if applicable)
   - Validate proper variable declarations
   - Check for magic numbers/strings

3. **Maintainability & Readability Analysis:**
   - Assess function complexity (cyclomatic complexity)
   - Evaluate function length (should be reasonable)
   - Check variable naming clarity
   - Review code organization and structure
   - Assess comment quality and documentation
   - Identify overly complex logic

4. **Anti-Pattern Detection:**
   - Identify code smells (duplicated code, long functions)
   - Detect language-specific anti-patterns
   - Find improper global usage
   - Spot tight coupling between modules
   - Identify monolithic functions
   - Detect violation of DRY principle

5. **Refactoring Recommendations:**
   - Suggest modularization opportunities
   - Recommend function extraction for clarity
   - Propose design pattern applications
   - Suggest performance optimizations
   - Recommend code reuse strategies
   - Identify technical debt priorities

**Approach**: **Expected Output:**
- Code quality grade (A-F) with justification
- Standards compliance checklist
- Anti-patterns detected with file:line references
- Maintainability score and improvement areas
- Top 5 refactoring priorities with effort estimates
- Best practice violations and fixes
- Technical debt assessment
- Specific code improvement recommendations
- Quick wins vs long-term improvements

Please provide a comprehensive code quality assessment with specific, actionable recommendations.

**Bash Quality Standards:**
Use shellcheck, quote variables, use set -euo pipefail
