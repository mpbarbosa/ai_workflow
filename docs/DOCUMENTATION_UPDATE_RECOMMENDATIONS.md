## Files Updated (Completed ✅)

### Critical Priority - COMPLETED

#### 1. docs/PROJECT_REFERENCE.md ✅
**Status**: Updated to v2.6.0  
**Changes Applied**:
- Version header updated (v2.4.0 → v2.6.0)
- Last Updated date changed (2025-12-23 → 2025-12-24)
- Project Identity version updated (v2.4.0 → v2.6.0)
- Core Features section header updated (v2.4.0 → v2.6.0)
- Added Developer Experience section with v2.6.0 features
- Removed "NEW" tag from v2.4.0 features
- Added v2.6.0 and v2.5.0 to version history

**Rationale**: This is the designated "SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH" and must be kept current.

#### 2. docs/ROADMAP.md ✅
**Status**: Version reference clarified  
**Changes Applied**:
- Changed "Version: 2.0.0" to "Project Version: v2.6.0"
- Clarified distinction between document and project version

**Rationale**: Prevents confusion about which version is referenced.

## Files Already Current (No Updates Needed ✅)

These files were already at v2.6.0 or don't require version updates:

### Primary Documentation
- ✅ **README.md** - Already shows v2.6.0 with correct badges
- ✅ **docs/RELEASE_NOTES_v2.6.0.md** - Complete v2.6.0 release documentation
- ✅ **docs/MAINTAINERS.md** - Last Updated 2025-12-24 (current)
- ✅ **docs/README.md** - Last Updated 2025-12-24 (current)
- ✅ **docs/DOCUMENTATION_UPDATES_v2.6.0.md** - Comprehensive v2.6.0 documentation

### Archive Documentation
- ✅ **docs/archive/** - All files appropriately archived (no updates needed)

### Configuration Files
- ✅ **.github/copilot-instructions.md** - Current with v2.6.0 information
- ✅ **CONTRIBUTING.md** - Updated in v2.5.0 (no v2.6.0 changes needed)
- ✅ **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md** - Not version-specific
- ✅ **LICENSE** - Not version-specific

---

## Optional Updates (Low Priority)

These files could benefit from minor updates but are not critical:

### 1. docs/architecture/adr/README.md
**Current State**: May not reference v2.6.0 ADRs if any were created  
**Suggested Action**: Review if new ADRs need to be added for v2.6.0 features  
**Priority**: LOW  
**Effort**: 5 minutes

### 2. .vscode/tasks.json
**Current State**: Should already be current (added in v2.6.0)  
**Suggested Action**: Verify task descriptions are accurate  
**Priority**: LOW  
**Effort**: 2 minutes

### 3. templates/workflows/README.md
**Current State**: Should already document v2.6.0 templates  
**Suggested Action**: Verify examples are complete  
**Priority**: LOW  
**Effort**: 3 minutes

## Files That Do NOT Need Updates

The following files are intentionally NOT updated because they are:
- Historical records
- Version-specific documents
- Archive materials
- Temporary files

### Archive Documents (Intentionally Not Updated)
- `docs/archive/COMPREHENSIVE_WORKFLOW_EXECUTION_ANALYSIS.md`
- `docs/archive/PHASE2_COMPLETION.md`
- `docs/archive/WORKFLOW_AUTOMATION_VERSION_EVOLUTION.md`
- All other `docs/archive/*.md` files

### Version-Specific Documents (Intentionally Not Updated)
- `docs/RELEASE_NOTES_v2.4.0.md` (if exists)
- `docs/RELEASE_NOTES_v2.5.0.md` (if exists)
- Historical documentation

### Design Documents (No Version References Needed)
- `docs/architecture/clarify-*.md` - Design clarifications (no version needed)
- `docs/architecture/remove-nested-markdown-blocks.md` - Design decision (no version needed)
- Individual ADR files (each has its own date/context)

## Validation Checklist

Use these commands to verify documentation consistency:

### Version Consistency
```bash
# Should return v2.6.0 for PROJECT_REFERENCE.md
grep -n "Version.*v2\." docs/PROJECT_REFERENCE.md

# Should return v2.6.0 for ROADMAP.md
grep -n "Project Version" docs/ROADMAP.md

# Should NOT return PROJECT_REFERENCE.md with v2.4.0
grep -r "Current Version.*v2\.4" docs/*.md
```

### Date Consistency
```bash
# Should return 2025-12-24 for both files
grep "Last Updated.*2025-12-24" docs/PROJECT_REFERENCE.md docs/ROADMAP.md
```

### "NEW" Tag Management
```bash
# Should only show "NEW v2.6.0" or "NEW v2.5.0", not older versions
grep -n "NEW v2\." docs/PROJECT_REFERENCE.md

# Should NOT show "NEW v2.4" in PROJECT_REFERENCE.md
grep "NEW v2\.4" docs/PROJECT_REFERENCE.md
```

## Recommendations for Future Releases

### Release Process Enhancement
1. **Update Checklist**: Add to release process:
   - [ ] Update PROJECT_REFERENCE.md version (header, identity, features)
   - [ ] Add version to version history section
   - [ ] Update ROADMAP.md current status
   - [ ] Remove "NEW" tags from previous version
   - [ ] Add "NEW" tags to current version features
   - [ ] Update "Last Updated" dates
   - [ ] Verify version consistency across all docs

2. **Automation**: Consider creating:
   - Version update script (`scripts/update-version.sh`)
   - Version consistency validator (add to Step 2)
   - CI/CD check for version mismatches

3. **Documentation Standards**:
   - Document "NEW" tag lifecycle (current version only)
   - Clarify when archive documents should be created
   - Define version update process in CONTRIBUTING.md
