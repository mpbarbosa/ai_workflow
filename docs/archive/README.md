# Archive Directory

Historical documentation and legacy content preserved for reference.

## Purpose

This directory contains:
- Superseded documentation versions
- Historical design decisions
- Legacy guides replaced by current documentation
- Deprecated feature documentation

## Retention Policy

**Long-term Storage** - Content in archive/ is preserved indefinitely:
- Documents historical project evolution
- Provides context for architectural decisions
- References for migration paths from old features

## Organization

Archive content should be organized by:
- **Version** - Group by major version when content was active
- **Date** - Use YYYY-MM format for time-based organization
- **Feature** - Group related deprecated feature docs together

## When to Archive

Move documentation here when:
- Feature is deprecated and removed
- Documentation is superseded by newer version
- Content is historical but worth preserving
- Not actively maintained but useful for context
